            <h2>A simple system checking application written in C#</h2>
            <p class="date"><time datetime="2025-01-06">January 6th, 2025</time></p>
            <p>So the first smaller project for this year is written in C#. What you can do with this project is to list all 
                your harddrives togheter with their sizes in GB and free space available in GB. You are also able to list eventual
                network devices.</p>
            <p>I have been stumbling upon <em>LibreHardwareMonitor</em> which is a library that easlity let's you retrieve the 
            temperature of your GPU and CPU. Unfortunately I am not able (yet) to check the temperature of my processor's cores. The 
            GPU temp of my nvidia card shows without any problems.</p>
            <p>I will keep updating this project as I loved returning to C# for an hour or two and would love to improve.</p>
            <p>Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eTWdsFQVtebCfG19nXoRyW9ywjbrVAQO/view?usp=drive_link">link</a> to a .rar file. You will need to download, extract all files and run the .exe. Enjoy!</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">UPDATE:</span> The program can detect the temperature of (at least) the Intel CPUs. It works for me. You will need to right click on the .exe file and 
                choose "Run as administrator".</p>

            <h2>Update in my Flask Python file sharing server project</h2>
            <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-30">December 30th, 2024</time></p>
            <p>So after the Chritsmas week, I have decided to keep on working on projects and building my portfolio.
                I wanted to work on the Python and Flask project that I have been telling you more about 2 posts ago.
                I have managed to add more features to it.
            </p>
            <p><img src="./public/photos/Flask_Python_file_server_UPDATE_1.png" alt="Screenshot of Flask Python file server update showing file sizes"> &nbsp;<img src="./public/photos/Flask_Python_file_server_UPDATE_2.png" alt="Screenshot of Flask Python file server update showing file upload functionality"></p>
            <p>I have been working on showing the file sizes of the uploaded files. You can see it in both bytes and in MB, rounded to 4 decimals.
                You can also see that I have been added functionality to upload files with the same name as files already on the server.
            </p>
            <p>This is how it can look when you upload a file named books.json. There is a function in the code that scans the whole
                content of the folder. If it finds a file with that name, it will append a number at the end of the name. It is a counter
                that increases. So book.json became in this image books2.json.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><img src="./public/photos/Flask_Python_file_server_UPDATE_3.png" alt="Screenshot of a Flask Python file server update showing message of a file's size too large to upload"></p>
            <p>I have added a feature that limits the filesize you can upload to 10MB. You are able to change this file size limit 
                by changing the number from 10 to whatever you'd like.
            </p>
            <p>I'm more aware of what it can be done with Flask and I will keep improving this project. It it helpful to use it in the home network.
                You can check the code and experiment with it <a href="https://github.com/codeninjah/FileSharing-webserver">on GitHub</a>.

            <h2>Update in the keyboard app project</h2>
            <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-16">December 16th, 2024</time></p>
            <p>So, if you check the main page, you will find a video showcasing a project that I started with and that I decided I could use for users to test their keyboards.
                I got the idea to also implement a page that tests your PS4 controller. I got inspired while doing some research and tonight I have been working on the layout and
                it's not done but I think I've came a long way and I am proud to share this picture with you guys. Enjoy!

            <p>It is plain HTML and CSS!</p>

            <h2>New project repo on Git Hub</h2>
            <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-15">December 15th, 2024</time></p>
            <p>I have managed to create a basic file sharing web app using Python and Flask. I am really excited about Flask! My first time writing
                anything with it. This app let's you see the content of a shared folder on a local server, download files, let's you upload files.
                There is a limit of max 5 downloads per minute, which you can adjust by just changing a number. Also there is a log file created and
                more advanced logging such as ip numbers of visitors, names of files uploaded, downloaded etc.  
            </p>
            <p>A first security protection measure added is against path traversal attacks. <cite>A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) 
                aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder.</cite>

                 OWASP.org</a>. 
                 <br><br>You only need python installed and install two packages before you can give it a try. Here's a link to

            <h2>My Unsplash API project is now LIVE on Netlify</h2>
            <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-12">December 12th, 2024</time></p>
            <p>I have now managed to publish the Unsplash API project on Netlify. You are able to try it and "feel" it.
                For the more technical skilled people reading this, I had to change some of the initial code because I needed to hide my
                API key. So the solution was to run some NodeJS magic that would get the key from the environmental variables that Netlify
                let's you add somewhere in the priject dashboard. After that I needed to change some of the frontend code to fetch from 
                the needed endpoints. Of course, there are stuff I can improve. 
            </p>
            <p>Random pic on the landing page works every time. The search function works, the pagination works - the issue it would be that
                if you for example have tens of pages of pictures returning as results, and you wanna jump within seconds from page 1 to page 7 or 10 or
                20 etc, it may take a couple of seconds or you may have to wait a couple of seconds before clicking again on the same page link.
                Modal also works for when you click on the pictures. I haven't tried by myself how it works on the phone.</p>
            <p>Here is the link for you to <a href="https://unsplash-api-alexandru-florin.netlify.app/"> try this project</a>.</p>

                <h2>Biggest challenge right now</h2>
                <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-06">December 6th, 2024</time></p>
                <p>My biggest challenge right now is to learn enough to be able to code a properly control system with the 
                    mouse pointer in video game. I am going to be more specific and say that I need to learn about angles and
                    use that knowledge to keep pushing my skills in coding videogames. I am going to use ChatGPT to help me get through this.
                    Come back for more updates!</p>
