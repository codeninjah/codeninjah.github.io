            <h2>My Unsplash API project is now LIVE on Netlify</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-12-12">December 12th, 2024</time>
            <p>I have now managed to publish the Unsplash API project on Netlify. You are able to try it and "feel" it.
                For the more technical skilled people reading this, I had to change some of the initial code because I needed to hide my
                API key. So the solution was to run some NodeJS magic that would get the key from the environmental variables that Netlify
                let's you add somewhere in the priject dashboard. After that I needed to change some of the frontend code to fetch from 
                the needed endpoints. Of course, there are stuff I can improve. 
            </p>
            <p>Random pic on the landing page works every time. The search function works, the pagination works - the issue it would be that
                if you for example have tens of pages of pictures returning as results, and you wanna jump within seconds from page 1 to page 7 or 10 or
                20 etc, it may take a couple of seconds or you may have to wait a couple of seconds before clicking again on the same page link.
                Modal also works for when you click on the pictures. I haven't tried by myself how it works on the phone.</p>
            <p>Here is the link for you to <a href="https://unsplash-api-alexandru-florin.netlify.app/"> try this project</a>.</p>

                <h2>Biggest challenge right now</h2>
                <p class="date"><time datetime="2024-12-06">December 6th, 2024</time></p>
                <p>My biggest challenge right now is to learn enough to be able to code a properly control system with the 
                    mouse pointer in video game. I am going to be more specific and say that I need to learn about angles and
                    use that knowledge to keep pushing my skills in coding videogames. I am going to use ChatGPT to help me get through this.
                    Come back for more updates!</p>
