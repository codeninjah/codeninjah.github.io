            </video>
            <p>In this project, I am using the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a>. It works well, Pagination is there,
                the results are returned as they should, a random pic renders everytime you visit the landing page and I have also managed to implement a modal, which pops up when you click on either of the pictures.</p>
            <p><h3>Update: </h3>I have now learned to deploy apps on Netlify. You can now try this project by yourself, I have posted the link above the video. 
            As I needed to hide my API key, I needed to use some kind of NodeJS magic for the backend and then change the frontend code to fetch from the backend.
            I need to mention that there are only a couple of hundreds or thousands of request per hour. Also the pagination works and if you for exemple
        have tens or hundreds of pages to load with pictures, you may have some loading time to wait if you jump let's say from 1st page to page 20 or 30. Enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Game development</h3>
            <p>My first game made in Pygame</p>

                <p>This is my attempt to code a videogame in Python using the Pygame library. I've got the idea to try this while attending a Hackathon.
                    Working with videogames has been my childhood dream and it feels a bit surreal to be able to develop simple games.
                    The challenges I face is actually a deeper understading of maths; calculations of angles to be more precise.
                    As of now you can control the soldier with the arrow buttons and rotate him in all directions using the mouse. There are some
                    enemies spawned across the screen and you can shoot bullets by clicking the mouse's left button. It is however, as you can see
                    a challenge to get all these angles right. More work needs to be done.</p>

            <p>This project uses the <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">NASA API</a> for searching and accessing media. It is built in PHP. The search function is running, pagination with Previos and Next buttons is implemented.
                You can see how many items and pages your search query returns aswell as the posibility to either view images or videos, if not combined.</p>

            </video>
            <p>This project is written in JavaScript. It was thinked of as being a project with advanced features that
                would help its users to type faster. I have decided to make it instead as a project where you can test that
                the different buttons on your keyboard are functioning. It would work in such way that when you click a button,
                you would see it marked as yellow in the webbrowser. In that way you would know if your computer can detect the keypress
                or not. Not all buttons of the keyboard are implemented yet. It is however another hobby project that I like to showcase
                just because of remembering the fun I had coding it.
